Mature network simulation package aimed at researchers. Was thinking maybe
could be used to simulation ptube or patient flow but seems so specific
to computer networks that the additional complexity not worth it.

Still might be useful for learning how to architect a similar, simpler,
simulation package for healthcare systems.

NetworkX + SimPy

Forked from ComplexNetworkSim (Python 2)

This app has definite similarities to patient flow simulation. Docs
address things like workflow and simulating multiple scenarios.
