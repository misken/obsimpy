Getting started with using SimPy to build patient flow discrete event simulation models. 

I fixed the following links so they now points to my new Bits Of Analytics blog.

- [An object oriented SimPy patient flow simulation model](https://bitsofanalytics.org/posts/simpy-oo-patflow-model/simpy-oo-patflow-model.html)

Some more recent work includes:
