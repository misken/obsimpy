    "In [Part 1 of this series](http://hselab.org/simpy-getting-started-patient-flow-modeling.html), we built a few simple patient flow simulation models using SimPy. They all were *process oriented*. In this post, I'll share my first attempt at an object oriented (OO) SimPy model for the same system. As mentioned in my previous post, I've had good luck building large complex discete event simulation models (including patient flow) with the object oriented Java library Simkit. In the process of building these initial OO models, I learned a bunch from the [posts done by the folks at Grotto Networking](https://www.grotto-networking.com/DiscreteEventPython.html#Intro)."

While I love chaining/piping via [magrittr](https://github.com/smbache/magrittr), especially when using the mighty [dplyr](https://github.com/tidyverse/dplyr) package, I'm wondering if this will tie simmer to a process oriented simulation world view. I can see how the notion of a *trajectory* might lend itself to chaining and piping. Let's find out. I'll post the simmer version as soon as I get one working.\n"
